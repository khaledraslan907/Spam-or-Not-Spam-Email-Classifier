# Spam-or-Not-Spam-Email-Classifier
This project implements a simple web application using **Streamlit** that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** (Ham) based on their content. The classification model is built using a **Logistic Regression** classifier and trained on a dataset of labeled email messages.
